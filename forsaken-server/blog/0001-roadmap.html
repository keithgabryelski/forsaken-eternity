      I think the best gift given from Allah is the friendship. Friendship is a
      bond which cannot be broken with any power. Who you are and where you
      from, your power can’t break a friendship. I can say, even Hitlar didn’t
      have this power to break it. It is the toughest relationship in this
      galaxy.

      I’ve got some friends in my life. They’re the most valuable person to me.
      There is no other reasons for it, only friendship. Most of the friends
      I’ve got in my life are very simple in their nature. They’re very
      friendly. They can sacrifice anything for me. They give me inspirations
      when I need. In fact I get everything. My life couldn’t be perfect if I
      didn’t meet some people. I don’t want to mention their name here because I
      can’t describe them with my bad English. After all, I have to say that
      I’ve got a best friend circle in the world. We’ve got us, we’ve got each
      other. Thanks duds for being with me….
